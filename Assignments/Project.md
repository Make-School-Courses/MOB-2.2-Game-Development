# Custom Game - Final project ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ²ðŸ§©ðŸŽ®â™Ÿ

## Description

This term we covered topics that gave you the tools needed to build a mobile game. Wether you do it with SpriteKit or take the challenge with SceneKit, by the end of the term you'll have a working version of a game that not only is visually attractive but is also fun and engages users.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able to:

1. Implement topics from the course into a mobile game.
1. Conduct user tests with early versions of the game
1. Elaborate a Game Design Document to back all of the choices behind the game.
1. Practice the process of publishing an app to Testflight

## Schedule

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE:**

From the day this project is assigned, you will have **3 weeks** to complete this project. A sample weekly outline is provided to assist you in planning your project.

**Important note:** Week 01 refers to the first calendar day of the project being assigned, and subsequent days will follow this reference:

- Week 01:
  - Project assigned, read the project spec, ask any clarifying questions you may have, finish the game design document. Create a kanban board to assist with tasks and start the development.
  - Main architecture of the game is done. Starting to add some nodes and core mechanics.
- Week 02:
  - Already conducted at least one user testing. Adjust the game with feedback.
  - Game is functional and has some juice.
- Week 03:
  - Fix any remaining bugs, upload to Testflight and prepare presentation.
  - Presentation Day, submit links to tracker.

## Requirements
List out requirements for the project here

1. Make a copy of [this Game Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-I08qX76DgSFyN1ByIGtPuqXh7bVKraHcNIA25tpAzE/edit) and fill it our with the content of your game (skip the Assets section).
1. Evidence of at least one user testing session to get feedback (can be notes, video, before and after screenshots). Add this to the Game Design document.
1. Functional Game with SpriteKit or SceneKit that includes at least 6 of the following:
  - Core mechanics (not optional)
  - Collision detection
  - Physics
  - Textures
  - Sounds
  - Moving background or parallax effect
  - Particle emitters
  - Scoring system
  - Displaying messages or useful game data
1. Game uploaded to Testflight

## Commit Requirements

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the project, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

### Why are we doing this?
We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for a more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.
