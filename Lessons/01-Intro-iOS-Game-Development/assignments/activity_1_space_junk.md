# Space Junk Removal

## Your Assignment
Your client, Intergalactic Rubbish Removal, Inc., is on a mission to rid the cosmos of the massive accumulation of [space junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris).

To gain support for their cause, they have commissioned you to create a free iOS game app to illustrate to children of all ages the process and pitfalls of collecting space garbage.

### Requirements/characteristics
The final released version of the game will have the following characteristics:

1. App Name: AstroJunk
2. Protagonist (user entity) &mdash; User will pilot a single spaceship: an interstellar garbage scow
3. Game type &mdash; Fixed Shooter game:
- Ship is restricted to movement along the X axis
- Target objects move in only one direction (top to bottom) and only originate (descend) from the top of the screen
- Each level of the game is contained within a single screen
3. Game Play:
- The object of the game is to collect as many pieces of floating space junk as possible, while avoiding collisions with hostile objects (meteorites or alien bombs)
- Points are awarded for each piece of debris captured, and the total score tabulated and presented on screen
- If pilot fails to avoid a hostile object, the collision of the object with the ship will result in the ship exploding &mdash; and Game Over!
