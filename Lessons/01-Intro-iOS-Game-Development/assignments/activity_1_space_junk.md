# Space Junk Removal

## Your Assignment
Your client, Intergalactic Rubbish Removal, Inc., is on a mission to rid the cosmos of the massive accumulation of [space junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris).

To gain support for their cause, they have commissioned you to create a free iOS game app to illustrate to children of all ages the process and pitfalls of collecting space garbage.

### Requirements/characteristics
The final released version of the game will have the following characteristics:

1. App Name: AstroJunk
2. Protagonist (user entity) &mdash; User will pilot a single spaceship: an interstellar garbage scow
3. Game Type &mdash; game will be similar to a **Fixed Shooter**<sup>1</sup> game (ie, like the classic Space Invaders game):
- Ship is restricted to movement along the X axis
- Target objects move in only one direction (top to bottom) and only originate (descend) from the top of the screen
- Each level of the game is contained within a single screen
3. Game Play:
- The object of the game is to collect as many pieces of floating space junk as possible, while avoiding collisions with hostile objects (meteorites or alien bombs)
- Points are awarded for each piece of debris captured, and the total score tabulated and presented on screen
- If pilot fails to avoid a hostile object, the collision of the object with the ship will result in the ship exploding &mdash; and Game Over!

<!-- TODO: rewrite this as a User Story? -->

### TODO: For this phase of the game

For this __*first released version*__ of AstroJunk, you are to:

1. Create the basic SpriteKit game app project

2. Applying the concepts covered so far, you must also create all sprites/nodes required for the game including:

- background scene

- meteorites

- alien bombs

- space ship

At this point, these will be static nodes only &mdash; since we have not covered motion yet, none of these sprites need to be able to move at this point...

<!-- TODO: students will need to get graphic assets? -->

### Instructor Demo

For ideas of how the game will eventually look and behave...

<!-- TODO: Instructor to demo game app prototype/POC version  -->
