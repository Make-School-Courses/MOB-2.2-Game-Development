## Why you should know this or industry application (5 min)
The key to making a popular game app is polish: adding loads of well-considered details that set your game apart and bring it to life.

To push your game to that next level &mdash; to really entertain and delight your users, to get them to engage with your game &mdash; you absolutely *must* add what is known as __*"juice."*__

Adding juice means tricking out your game with special effects such as:

- Scenes and Scene Transitions
- Simple Animation (scaling, rotation, movement, and more)
- Music and Sound Effects
- Game Mechanics (including Victory or Game Over Conditions)
- Particle Effects (explosions, collisions, fire, etc.)
- Screen Effects

When every interaction within your game world results in a cascade of visual and audible feedback really adds depth and dimension to the user experience and keeps users coming back for more.

As you develop your game, you will get in the habit of adding juice to it as you go...

> Most of the tools to create the special effects listed above are already in your iOS toolkit; others, such as music and sound effects, can be found online or created with free or inexpensive software


<!-- TODO:  Describe "Juice" here -- it is an umbrella under which all topics in the outline for this lesson fit properly -->

<!-- TODO: search ref books 1 and 2 for ideas on how to describe, exemplify "juice" -->


## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe:
- What Game Mechanics are and how to implement them
- The functional relationship between the `SKView` and `SKScene` classes, and how to use them to create new scenes
- How to create transitions between game scenes using `SKTransition`
- iOS’s three built-in support mechanisms for playing both sound effects and background music, and how to use them to create sound FX in a game
- how to work with SpriteKit Particle Effects to create special effects

2. Implement in your running class project, AstroJunk:
- Background music
- Sound effects, in response to game events/mechanics
- Game Mechanics, including a Game Over Scene that reacts to Win/Loss conditions (Victory Conditions)
- SpriteKit Particle Systems to add explosions/fire in response to game entity events (collisions, etc.)

## Initial Exercise (20 min)

### As A Class

Discuss these topics related to **Game Mechanics ...**

**Topic 1:** From your assignment at the end of last class, what key game mechanisms <sup>1</sup> stood out most prominently in your mind when you read Wikipedia's definition of the term, "Game mechanics"?

**Topic 2:** Think about the current state of your AstroJunk game....

**Q:** What game mechanisms are the most obviously missing from AstroJunk so far?

**Q:** What game mechanics would you add to AstroJunk first? (i.e., what would add the most value to the game? Does the order that you develop game mechanisms matter?)

[Optional] Diagram the UI flow of the top 1 or 2 game mechanisms identified by the class as the first to implement.

 > <sup>1</sup> [Game mechanics - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics)

<!-- INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
- the idea is to review Game Mechanics, and to get students thinking about what is missing from AstroJunk at this point, as a lead in to TT1 and later in-class activities
- some of the most obviously missing mechanisms now:
- a way to rack up points for either (a) asteroid or bomb hits (b) debris that has slipped by the ship (could add up to negative points), and/or (c) positive points accrued when the ship collects debris
...all of these are prerequisites to developing a GameOver scene and/or its Win/Loss conditions.
- Victory conditions (Loss avoidance, Victory points, Combination conditions, etc. <sup>1</sup>) - as mentioned above, this is missing, but Win/Loss is also dependent on some sort of score accrual (i.e., Victory points and/or Loss avoidance)...
- game Levels
- also, what "juice" can b added? Sound effects? explosions on collision? other?

## Working with Scenes &mdash; [Overview/TT I] (20 min)
Up to now, you've been working with game environments comprised of only a single scene.

This is fine for learning how to add basic functionality like elements and actions.

But to really delight and engage your users, you'll want them to have more opportunities to interact with your game than a single scene can provide.

You've probably also noticed that most games come with a very common set of standard features which often include:

- A Loading scene &mdash; Scene to display while other content is loading.
- Menus &mdash; Uses might include showing the game's logo, starting a new game or resuming a paused one, navigation to some other scene, showing game data such as high scores or game rules, or choosing what kind of game (mode) the user wants to play.
- Victory / Loss Conditions &mdash; Most games respond to "Game Over" or other win/lose conditions by presenting choices (scenes) to the user based on the win/lose state or when gameplay ends.
- Game Levels &mdash; A great way to engage users is to offer them the ability to progress to a new level through mastery of previous levels; each level is typically represented by its own scene (or set of scenes).

Learning how to work with scenes can really add depth and dimension to the user experience.

<!-- from Apple:
Scenes are the basic building blocks of games. Typically, you design self-contained scenes for the parts of your game, and then transition between these scenes as necessary. For example...

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sktransition -->


## Building Blocks
Creating new scenes or transitioning between scenes is easy if you understand the basic components SpriteKit uses to construct scenes. We've introduced some of those components already, but let's examine the core building blocks in more detail...

### View Controllers
Of course, view controllers and their lifecycle methods play a key role in bringing your scenes to life.

__*But remember:*__ In an iOS game app, the view you will be presenting is *not* the usual `UIView` that the view controller manages &mdash; it is a subclass of `SKView`, which has specific game scene behaviors built into it.

### SKScene
`SKScene` is a subclass of `SKEffectNode`, which is a subclass of `SKNode`.

As the root node in a tree of SpriteKit nodes (`SKNode`), an `SKScene` object organizes all of the active SpriteKit content, animating and rendering all of that content for display.

```Swift
class SKScene : SKEffectNode
 ```

### SKView
To display a scene, you present it from an `SKView` object.

```Swift  
class SKView : UIView
```

`SKView` is a subclass of `UIView` that renders a SpriteKit scene, but it has powerful game-based features above and beyond what `UIView` has, including that `SKView` allows you to:

1. control the timing of the view's screen updates, including pausing a scene.
2. configure toggles that have performance implications which are unique to your app.
3. display metrics in the bottom corner of the view for debugging purposes. For examples:
- `showsFPS`	&mdash; Displays a count of the current frame rate in Frames Per Second in the view.
- `showsNodeCount` &mdash; Displays a count of the current number of SKNodes being displayed in the view.
- `showsPhysics` &mdash; Displays a visual representation of the `SKPhysicsBodys` in the view.

#### presentScene()
You present a scene by calling the `presentScene(_:)` method on the scene's `SKView` object.

```Swift  
func presentScene(_ scene: SKScene?)
```
When the `presentScene(_:)` method is called, the new scene immediately replaces the current scene, if one exists.



### SKScene's Lifecycle Methods
`SKScene` comes with several functions you can override to be notified when the scene is loaded or presented, or it changes size.

Of these `SKScene` lifecycle methods, the one you will likely use the most is the `didMove(to:)` function which tells you when the scene is presented by a view.

```Swift  
func didMove(to view: SKView)
```

When you present a scene (by calling `presentScene(_:)`, for example), SpriteKit calls your scene's `didMove(to:)` method before it presents your scene in a view.

Thus, `didMove(to:)` offers you a good place to do some initial setup of your scene’s contents.

### Creating Scenes
Creating a new SpriteKit scene requires only these simple steps:

1. Create a new subclass that derives from `SKScene`
- Be sure that you import `SpriteKit`

2. Implement its desired behaviors.<sup>2</sup> This can include (but is not limited to):
- `init(size:)` &mdash; or a custom initializer
- `update(_:)`
- `didMove(to:)` and/or other `SKScene` lifecycle methods
- Functions for Touches or Movement *(Hint: Review Touch Events sections of Lesson 2 &mdash; Actions)*

3. Then load and present it at the desired place in your code
- New scenes are often loaded in either a ViewController's lifecycle method or in some function in the default `GameScene` class, including its `update(_:)` or `SKScene` lifecycle methods. But where your new scene is loaded and presented depends on your app's own requirements.

> <sup>2</sup> *HINT: For ideas on methods to implement in your new scene, review any overridden methods in the default `GameScene` class that is provided as part of Xcode's SpriteKit game app template.*

**Example:** </br>
The code snippet below is of a newly-created subclass of `SKScene` called `NewScene` which has several stubbed-out functions depicting a simple, standard implementation of a new SpriteKit scene.

```Swift
import Foundation
import SpriteKit

class NewScene: SKScene {

    override init(size: CGSize) {
        // do initial configuration work here
        super.init(size: size)
    }

    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {
        // Called before each frame is rendered
    }

    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        // Use this method to implement any custom behavior for your scene when it is about to be presented by a view. For example, you might use this method to create the scene’s contents.
    }
}
```

...and here is a basic example of how one could instantiate and present an instance of `NewScene` in some ViewController's `viewWillAppear()`:

```Swift
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
     let myNewScene = NewScene()
     myNewScene.size = self.view.bounds.size
     if let spriteView = self.view as? SKView { // cast self.view as an SKView before calling presentScene()
         spriteView.presentScene(myNewScene)
     }
 }
```

#### The `scaleMode` Property
Because your scene might appear on screens of different sizes (i.e., iPhone, iPad, etc.), it is important to determine how the scene should be sized to fit into the `SKView` for different devices.

How the `SKView` scales the scene is determined by its `scaleMode` property.

```Swift  
var scaleMode: SKSceneScaleMode { get set }
```

Under the hood, the `scaleMode` property is backed by the `SKSceneScaleMode` enum, which offers these cases:

- `.fill`
- `.aspectFill`
- `.aspectFit`
- `.resizeFill`

The default value is `SKSceneScaleMode.fill`.

> *See these links for more on the `scaleMode` property or `SKSceneScaleMode`:*
> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skscenescalemode
> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skscene/scaling_a_scene_s_content_to_fit_the_view

### Changing Scenes (Transitions)
While the simple, direct manner outlined above works fine for presenting some new scene objects, most game scenes will benefit from more dramatic transitional effects.

#### SKTransition
`SKTransition` is an object used to perform an animated transition to a new scene.

It affords you the option of using a transition to animate the change from an old scene to a new scene, which provides continuity so that the scene change is not quite so abrupt.

```Swift  
class SKTransition : NSObject
```

*Source:* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sktransition

**Example:** </br>
A simple example showing `scaleMode` property and a `crossFade` transition:

```Swift  
myNewScene = NewScene(size: size)
myNewScene.scaleMode = .aspectFill

let crossFade = SKTransition.crossFade(withDuration: 0.5)
view?.presentScene(myNewScene, transition: crossFade)
```

#### Creating Scenes with Custom `init()`
Another common pattern for setting up your scene is to create a custom initialization method in your new game scene class.

In the example below, we added a custom initializer that takes just one extra parameter: a Boolean that should be `true` if this is the first time the player played the game and `false` if it is not. We store this value in a property named `firstTime`.

```Swift  
class GameLoadingScene: SKScene {
  let firstTime:Bool
  init(size: CGSize, firstTime: Bool) {
    self.firstTime = firstTime
    super.init(size: size)
  }
  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
  }
}
```

...and we could use this Boolean flag to make conditional decisions at key points in the scene's lifecycle, such as in the `didMove(to:)`, or elsewhere, when the scene is presented:

```Swift  
override func didMove(to view: SKView) {

  if (!firstTime) {
    // If not first time, start regular game
  } else {
    // If players first time, do first time things (i.e., explain rules, offer video explaining gameplay, etc.)
  }
}
```

## In Class Activity I (30 min)

Let's start __*adding game mechanics*__<sup>1</sup> to AstroJunk...

### As Individuals
So far, AstroJunk has no mechanism for Win/Loss (aka, Victory) conditions.

Applying what you've learned so far about working with SpriteKit scenes &mdash; and using ideas from the class discussion in today's initial exercise &mdash; you are to begin adding the first piece of a Win/Loss condition to your AstroJunk game.

**Output:**
The output or final product at the end of this in-class exercise will only be a new scene called "Game Over" that you will present when the user achieves either a Win or Loss state. Once the your new scene is presented, tapping anywhere on its screen/view should restart the game.

How the Win / Loss states are achieved will ultimately be up to you (and you will create these Victory Conditions as an After Class assignment later.)

But, for now, you only need to create a simple Boolean condition that will be used to invoke the presentation of your "Game Over" scene, present the scene, and restart the game when the new scene's view is touched.

**TODO:**
1. Create a new subclass of `SKScene` called `GameOverScene`

2. In your `GameScene` class, you will need a counter that will be incremented any time the spaceship captures a piece of space debris

- When this flag increments to 3, invoke your new `GameOverScene`

3. In your new `GameOverScene` class, you will need to implement:

- a Boolean flag named `won` representing whether the player has won the most recent game play or not

- a `didMove(to:)` function with a conditional statement that shows a label stating "You Won!" when the `won` flag is true, or "You lose...", when the `won` flag is false

- some function which will restart the game when the user taps the screen of the `GameOverScene`

<!-- INSTRUCTOR NOTE: The `touchesBegan(_:with:)` function might be the best place for this (but not the only appropriate function) -->

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE - here is what the new GameOverScene could look like:

class GameOverScene: SKScene {
  let won:Bool
  private var stateLabel : SKLabelNode?

  init(size: CGSize, won: Bool) {
    self.won = won
    super.init(size: size)
  }

  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
  }
}

override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
  var background: SKSpriteNode
  if (won) {
    stateLabel.text = "You Win"
  } else {
    stateLabel.text = "You Lose"
  }
  background.position =
    CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
  self.addChild(background)
  // More here...
} -->



<!-- TODO: create and add graphics to show the Win and Loss graphics for the GameOverScene-->

<!-- TODO:  challenge: add debugging steps to the SKView object? -->



## Sound &mdash; [Overview/TT II]  (20 min)
> George Lucas, the creator of the *Star Wars* movies, once famously said: "The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie." <sup>3</br>

It's just as important in game apps.

One of the biggest mistakes a game developer can make is to underestimate the power of audio.

When a game includes awesome sound effects that respond to visible gameplay elements and great-sounding background music, players become immersed in the game's world.

### Sound in SpriteKit apps
Thankfully, the good folks at Apple realize the importance of sound! They've included some really flexible, really cool sound capabilities in SpriteKit...

iOS supports three built-in functional mechanisms in SpriteKit for including sound effects and music in your game:

1. `AVAudioPlayer` &mdash; Part of the `AVFoundation` framework. It's an audio player that provides playback of audio data from a file or from memory.
- Gives you the most power and control over audio playback.
- Requires the most work to implement.

2. `SKAction` &mdash; Allows you to create sound *actions* &mdash; subclasses of `SKAction` that you can use to control your sound effects which can be implemented like any other `SKAction` (including participation in group or sequence actions).

- Best for short, one-time audio clips (not as good for background music or other long-playing sound files)
- Audio actions are instantaneous, which makes them more useful when chaining or reusing `SKAction` objects.

3. `SKAudioNode` &mdash; A subclass of `SKNode` that plays audio.
- Good for background music or other audio for which you might want to control stop and start.
- Can also be used for Sound FX.
- Because it is a subclass of `SKNode`, you can also manipulate it by passing `SKAction` objects to it.
- Affords more power and control than `SKAction`, but has fewer controlling functions than `AVAudioPlayer`.

*Sources: Various Apple Docs*

### Adding Background Music
Music plays an important part in setting the pace and emotional tone of a movie.

In game apps, background music servers a similar purpose.

And adding background music to your game is easy.

But there are important considerations you should be aware of.

**Considerations** </br>
Here are a few key points to consider when adding background music:

1. **For long-running files** &mdash; Use `AVAudioPlayer` for playing long-running files such as background music.

2. **Prevent Sound Delays**

- load files ahead of time, before the sound needs to be played, to avoid playback delays (but weigh this against memory consumption: lots of long-running sound files can eat up memory)

> *Typically music and large audio files should be streamed, if possible. For small sound effects, it’s better to preload them into memory for faster playback.*

3. **Create utility classes** &mdash; for handling audio, including `AVAudioPlayer` functions, loading sound files, and so on

4. **Use Asset Catalogs** &mdash; To organize audio files, create a sound folder inside an Asset Catalog and store files there for loading


<!-- TODO: add more key points..

- see ref books for ideas and coverage  
-->

**Two Implementation Options** </br>
1. `AVAudioPlayer` provides more power and control.
2. `SKAudioNode` is easier to implement

__*AVAudioPlayer Example*__ </br>
This simple, non-working code snippet illustrates the key steps needed to add background music to a game app by implementing an instance of `AVAudioPlayer`:

```Swift  
import AVFoundation // 1)

public var backgroundMusicPlayer: AVAudioPlayer? // 2)

public func playBackgroundMusic(_ filename: String) {
    let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: filename, withExtension: nil) // 3)
    if (url == nil) {
      print("Could not find file: \(filename)")
      return
    }

    var error: NSError? = nil
    do {
      backgroundMusicPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url!) // 4)
    } catch let error1 as NSError {
      error = error1
      backgroundMusicPlayer = nil
    }
    if let player = backgroundMusicPlayer {
      player.numberOfLoops = -1 // 5)
      player.prepareToPlay() // 6)
      player.play() // 7)
    } else {
      print("Could not create audio player: \(error!)")
    }
  }

  // any place in your code you want to play the BG music...
  playBackgroundMusic("backgroundMusic.wav") // 8)

  // ...at some point, you want to stop playing...
  backgroundMusicPlayer.stop() // 9)
```

Let's breakdown the key events in this code snippet:

1) For access to the `AVAudioPlayer`, we imported the `AVFoundation` framework

2) Here, we simply create an instance variable that is of type `Optional: AVAudioPlayer` for later use

3) We want to pass the location (as a URL) of whatever file we want to play to the `AVAudioPlayer` variable:

- To get the location of the file, we use the `Bundle` class’s `url(forResource:, withExtension:)` function because it allows us to access the location of __*any*__ resource that has been added to the app’s Xcode target

4) Here, we pass the location of the file to play to the `AVAudioPlayer` instance, handling any of the typical file I/O errors that are commonly-known to occur

5) To loop playback, you change the `numberOfLoops`<sup>4</sup> property on your `AVAudioPlayer` instance:

By setting the `numberOfLoops` property, you can make an `AVAudioPlayer` play its file a single time or a fixed number of times before stopping. Or you can set it to run continuously until it is sent a `pause` or a `stop` message.

- To make an `AVAudioPlayer` play one time and then stop:

```Swift  
audioPlayer?.numberOfLoops = 0
```

> *This behavior is the same as the default behavior `AVAudioPlayer` &mdash; unless you configure it otherwise, `AVAudioPlayer` by default plays its sound only one time, stops the player, and unloads the player object from memory.*

- Setting the `numberOfLoops` property to `1` will make `AVAudioPlayer` play twice, then stop:

```Swift  
audioPlayer?.numberOfLoops = 1
```

After it’s finished playing, a second call to `play()` will rewind it and play it again.

6) Calling the `prepareToPlay()` method on the player object minimizes the lag between calling the `play()` method and the start of sound output by preparing the audio player's hardware and memory buffers required for playback.

> *Note that if the audio player is not already prepared for playback, the `prepareToPlay()` method will be called implicitly by the `play()` method when it is called, but this will likely result in the sound lag mentioned.*

7) Calling `play()` on the player will asynchronously play the sound file passed to the player

8) At the desired point(s) in your code, call the `playBackgroundMusic()` function, passing in the audio file you want to play

9) At key points in your game &mdash; when your Game Over Scene is presented, for example &mdash; you'll to stop playback:

- To stop playback, you use the `pause()` or `stop()` functions <sup>4</sup>

__*SKAudioNode Example*__ </br>
The simplest way to add audio to a SpriteKit scene is to add a child `SKAudioNode` to it.

`SKAudioNode` was introduced in iOS 9 as an alternative to `SKAction.playSoundFileNamed(...)`.

`SKAudioNode` is much more powerful than its alternative:
- Sounds are played automatically using `AVFoundation`.
- Can be added as a child to a SpriteKit `SKNode`.
- The node can optionally add 3D spatial audio effects to the audio when it is played (3D audio mixing is added automatically if the attribute `isPositional` is set to `true`), which allows you to pan your audio left and right.
- It loops its audio file by default.
- It allows stopping and restarting audio whenever you want.

```Swift  
let audioNode = SKAudioNode(fileNamed: "drums.mp3")
spriteKitViewController.scene.addChild(audioNode)
audioNode.isPositional = false // 1)
audioNode.run(SKAction.stop()) // 2)
audioNode.run(SKAction.play()) // 3)
```

Let's examine what's happening in the code above:

1) `isPositional` is a Boolean property that indicates whether the node’s audio is altered based on the position of the node.

- The default value is `true`, the audio mixer considers the position and velocity of the `SKAudioNode` relative to scene's current listener<sup>5</sup> node. This means the audio is attached to the node and, if the node moves, the audio moves with it.

- If `false`, then the sound is played normally.

2) Pass an `SKAction` to the node to stop audio playback.

3) Restart audio playback.

- https://tutorials.tinyappco.com/SwiftGames/Sound


### Adding Sound FX
Adding sounds effects that play at just the right moments is another great way to add "juice" to your game, as they can also significantly enhance user immersion in your game's world.

One of the best initial strategies for adding sound to your game is to tie effects to game events. Examples:

1. **Game State events** &mdash; which can include:
- Game start
- Game over (Win/Lose conditions)
- New game level achieved
- Game progress is paused
- Game reload from a saved state

2. **Player events** &mdash; such as:
- Collisions
- Points scored
- Loot, powers or weapons acquired


<!-- TODO: 888 see Game State Management section in ref book on 3D games for ideas on when you would add sound to act as Game State cues  -->


**Simple Example** </br>
Listed below are several sound actions created with `SKAction.playSoundFileNamed(...)` that one might set as constants in a utility file or in a project's `GameScene` file:

```Swift
let soundGameStart = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("gameStart.wav", waitForCompletion: true)
let soundCoinDrop = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("coinDrop.wav", waitForCompletion: true)
let soundPointScored = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("pointScored.wav", waitForCompletion: true)
let wallCollisionSound: SKAction = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("hitWall.wav", waitForCompletion: false)
let soundGameOver = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("player_die.wav", waitForCompletion: false)
let soundWin = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("winning.wav", waitForCompletion: false)
```

- Each sound action will load and play an audio file.
- Because they were defined before they were needed, they will be preloaded into memory &mdash; which prevents the game from stalling when you play any of them for the first time. (Typically music and large audio files should be streamed, but for small sound effects, it’s better to preload them into memory for faster playback.
)

To play them, pass them to a `run()` function, just as you did with any `SKAction` in previous lessons:

```Swift  
run(wallCollisionSound)
```

**Sequence Example** </br>
One of the cool things about sound actions created using `SKAction.playSoundFileNamed(...)` is that you can associate them with a set of actions &mdash; perhaps a set of actions that all occur at the time of some game event &mdash; and include them in group or sequence actions.

Expanding on the set of actions declared in the example above (and assuming that `action1` and `action2` are `SKActions` declared somewhere else), we could include a sound action as one of the actions that are executed together as part of a sequence:

```Swift
let sequenceWallCollisionAction = SKAction.sequence([action1, action2, wallCollisionSound])
```

**Random Selection Example** </br>
To add variety to your game's world, `SKAction.playSoundFileNamed(...)` also let's you set up an array of similar effects from which your code can randomly choose a sound file to play:

```Swift  
let soundCarCrashesArray = [
  SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("carCrash1.wav", waitForCompletion: false),
  SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("carCrash2.wav", waitForCompletion: false),
  SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("carCrash3.wav", waitForCompletion: false)
]
```

Then, depending on game conditions, you could choose which of the similar effects to run:

```Swift  
 run(soundCarCrashesArray[2])
```

> __*TIP:*__ *As you can imagine, you might also randomize the index of the array, which could allow your game to appear lively by choosing similar sounds, at random, for the same or similar game events.*


## In Class Activity II (30 min)

Let's add audio to AstroJunk...

### As Individuals
Using the audio files you gathered in the previous lesson:

- Add background music to be played while the game runs. Make the music stop at Game Over and any other appropriate game states
- Add sound FX to appropriate game events (collisions, points scored, etc.)

## Particle emitter

Adding particle systems to your games is an effective way to add special effects. With particle systems you can simulate: water, smoke, fire, snow, stars, sparks, rain, bubbles, explosions, and much more.

How the effect is created is by using a small image texture and a configuration file.

*Source: 2D Apple Games by Tutorials*

SpriteKit makes it easy to create and use particle systems by giving you a special node nam [ed `SKEmitterNode`, its purpose is to make particle systems and render them as quickly as possible.
You can create particles programmatically or with the particle editor. The second one is helpful to use since you can make changes to the values making up the particle and see the results being animated.

To do this, you simply create a new file with the iOS/Resource/SpriteKit Particle File template. This will create an .sks file that can be modified with the editor.

Once in code you’ll only need to instantiate the particles with the file and a position. Then add the particle emitter as child in the scene.

```Swift
let fireEmitter = SKEmitterNode(fileNamed: "Fire.sks")!
fireEmitter.position = CGPoint(x: 200, y: 200)
addChild(fireEmitter)

```

You can check what all the properties do [here](particleProperties.md).

## Activity

Create an .sks file for a new particle emitter. You want to add fire to the spaceship as it flies. Play around with all the values of the particle emitter until you’re happy with the result.

This is an example of how it might turn out like:

<!-- Resume: AstroJunk -- add Win / Loss conditions, such as Victory points for capturing debris, or Loss avoidance (negative points for getting hit by bombs/asteroids, or letting debris pass)
- present GameOverScene, with requisite graphic and sound effects for either (a) Win conditions or (b) Loss conditions...
- will require adding graphics

Q: Add a menu to allow player to (1) Start Over (2) Go to next level? ...or other?
-->

Assignments:

1. **Challenge** &mdash; Add the following to your AstroJunk game's Game Over scene:
- A __*menu*__ that, on winning the game, offers the user the option of choosing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) "Replay" or "Restart" &mdash; which replays the previous level of game just played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) "Next Level" &mdash; which offers the user a new level of the game to play (this means you will have to create at least one additional level)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) "High Scores" &mdash; presenting the user with a list of highest scores so far.

<!-- TODO: get URLS to illustrate adding menus, etc -->

<!-- Often, it’s best to start a game with an opening or main menu scene, rather than throw the player right into the action. The main menu often includes options to start a new game, continue a game, access game options and so on. -->
