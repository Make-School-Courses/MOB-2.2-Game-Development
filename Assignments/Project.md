# Custom Game - Final project ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ²ðŸ§©ðŸŽ®â™Ÿ

## Description

This term we covered topics that gave you the tools needed to build a mobile game. By the end of the term you'll have a working version of a game that not only is visually attractive but is also fun and engages users.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able to:

1. Implement topics from the course into a mobile game.
1. Conduct user tests with early versions of the game
1. Elaborate a Game Design Document to back all of the choices behind the game.
1. Practice the process of publishing an app to TestFlight (optional)

## Schedule

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE:**

From the day this project is assigned, you will have **2 weeks** to complete this project.

**Sample project plan:**
  - Project assigned, read the project spec, ask any clarifying questions you may have, finish the game design document.
  - Main architecture of the game is done. Starting to add some nodes and core mechanics.
  - Conduct at least one user testing. Adjust the game with feedback.
  - When the game is functional add some juice.
  - Fix any remaining bugs, upload to Testflight and prepare presentation.
  - Presentation Day, submit links to tracker.

## Requirements
