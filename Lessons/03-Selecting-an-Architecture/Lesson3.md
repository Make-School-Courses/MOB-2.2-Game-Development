## Why you should know this or industry application (5 min)
When you develop a game app, you need to pay particular attention upfront to how your app will handle various tasks that the game needs to perform: from handling user input, to rendering graphics, to updating AI components &mdash; along with the many small tasks your game might need to handle.

And for every game you make, you will need to create objects to represent game elements (aka, "entities") such as players, vehicles and other moving objects, projectiles, and so on.

Intelligently laying out your game's structure and organizing its content in ways which facilitate adding more content and game play elements will make game development much easier.
